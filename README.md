Rewrite the content with this update code and my explanation. Your job is to improve and fix grammar  

Sometimes, you need to create a function which take arguments of particular interface keys and whatever keys you will pass that according return the data with modified type of that interface which only include that keys which pass as arguments. So that in vscode i can access only that keys in dropdown.

When it's helpful?
When you need to fetch data from the database with some excluded keys or only selected keys.
Let's assume you have a student data with name, age, city keys. But you need to fetch the students data with just name and age keys, you does't need city for right now. Now you got a new data structure 

Which look like this interface
interface StudentType {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

Now you need this above interface to see proper vscode dropdown menu. If you not make what will happen, you will see "city" key also which is not present in current data.

For that this below code is an example of how you can create a modified type with using existing interface or type


```sh
// Utility type to create a union type from an array of keys
type CreateUnionType<T extends readonly (keyof StudentType)[]> = T[number];

interface StudentType {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    city: string;
}

export async function getStudents<T extends Array<keyof StudentType>>(...studentAttributes: T) {
    try {
        // Create a new type with only the specified attributes from StudentType
        type ModifiedStudentType = Pick<StudentType, CreateUnionType<T>>;

        // Fetch data from the API endpoint
        const response = await fetch("https://example.com/api/...");
        
        // Parse the response as JSON and type it according to the specified attributes
        const data: ModifiedStudentType = await response.json();
        
        // Return the data with the specified attributes
        return data;

    } catch (error) {
        // Handle errors by returning null
        return null;
    }
}

(async () => {
    const students = await getStudents("age", "name")
})
```
